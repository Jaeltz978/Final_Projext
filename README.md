# Final_Projext

While working on this final project I feel as though I've learned a great deal. Before walking into this I had never personally worked with a raspberry pi before. I also had no idea originally how I was going to get the raspberry pi to communicate with my Alexa. Through some research I was able to discover that I could utilize webhooks to trigger the start of the routine. As I was setting everything up, I found that I really struggled with lining the laser up with the photoresistor. I also failed to account for the amount of time a step would take, so the Alexa routine would restart when it should not have. To fix this I increased the time that the program would sleep for, and found that the initial value I used was too long and I had to reduce it slightly. I really enjoyed creating something that would give my roommates a reason to stay out of my room and I do plan on using this in the future
