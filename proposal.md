# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Routine Laser Tripwire

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A laser trip wire that triggers an alexa routine.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The software will take an input of the laser being tripped, then it will send that signal to a web server. which will then finally trigger the start of an alexa routine. I plan on using a service like IFTTT in order to allow for communication between the raspberry pi and the alexa device.  

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will accompish setting the raspverry pi and laser up into a functional trip wire.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be to have the alexa speak after receiving the input.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

the best outcome for my project is the raspberry pi and the alexa communicating to initiate routine that incorperates the use of alexa speaking and changing the lights.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to learn how to use a web host service in order to allow for communication between devices. I will also need to look into learning more about raspberry pi's as i only really know the basics about them. I plan on researching more into different methods of controlling an alexa device to find the most efficient to implement a connection between devices.
